        <h1>Life of Manny Pacquiao</h1>
        <p>
          Manny Pacquiao, in full Emmanuel Dapidran Pacquiao, byname Pac-Man,
          (born December 17, 1978, Kibawe, Bukidnon province, Mindanao,
          Philippines), professional boxer, media celebrity, and politician who
          became world-famous for winning boxing titles in more weight classes
          than any other boxer in history. His rise from abject poverty to the
          pinnacle of his sport was made even more remarkable by his life
          outside the ring. The charismatic “Pac-Man” was an idol and a unifying
          force in the Philippines, where his unprecedented popularity led to
          commercial endorsements, movies, television shows, CDs, and his image
          on a postage stamp. Pacquiao left home as a teenager and stowed away
          on a ship bound for Manila, where he became a boxer. He made his
          professional debut as a junior flyweight on January 22, 1995, at the
          age of 16. Many of his early bouts were televised on a program called
          Blow by Blow, where his all-action style and boyish smile quickly made
          him a favourite with Filipino boxing fans. He won his first major
          title on December 4, 1998, knocking out Thailand’s Chatchai Sasakul to
          capture the World Boxing Council (WBC) flyweight title. After failing
          to make weight, however, he lost the title to Medgoen Singsurat of
          Thailand in September 1999. Pacquiao moved up in weight class, and on
          June 23, 2001, in his first fight in the United States, he scored a
          sixth-round knockout of Lehlo Ledwaba to win the International Boxing
          Federation (IBF) junior featherweight title. Following four successful
          defenses, he knocked out Mexico’s Marco Antonio Barrera on November
          15, 2003, to become The Ring magazine featherweight champion. Lorem

          several years, Pacquiao engaged in a series of high-profile fights,
          winning the World Boxing Association (WBA) and IBF featherweight
          titles, the WBC and The Rings junior lightweight titles, and the WBC
          lightweight title. His rise was aided by American trainer Freddie
          Roach, who gradually transformed the left-handed slugger into a
          multifaceted boxer without detracting from his natural aggression or
          punching power. He was the Boxing Writers Association of America and
          The Rings Fighter of the Year in 2006 and 2008.On December 6, 2008,
          Pacquiao faced and thrashed American boxing star Oscar De La Hoya in a
          celebrated nontitle welterweight bout in Las Vegas. By then Pacquiao
          had become a complete fighter, combining excellent footwork, blazing
          speed, and a vastly improved defense, and he was widely considered,
          pound for pound, the world’s finest boxer. In addition, Pacquiao’s
          popularity as a pay-per-view (PPV) boxing attraction had increased
          steadily since 2002, but the match with De La Hoya was his
          breakthrough as a global phenomenon. The fight sold approximately 1.25
          million buys, generating roughly $70 million in PPV revenue, one of
          the largest PPV grosses in history for a nonheavyweight bout. On May
          2, 2009, Pacquiao won The Ring’s junior welterweight championship (his
          sixth weight class as a champion and his ninth as a professional
          boxer) with a spectacular one-punch second-round knockout of England’s
          Ricky Hatton. On November 14 he added another championship belt—in a
          record seventh weight class—when he defeated Miguel Cotto of Puerto
          Rico in 12 rounds to take the World Boxing Organization (WBO)
          welterweight title. Pacquiao defended that title on March 13, 2010, in
          Arlington, Texas, by defeating Ghanaian boxer Joshua Clottey in 12
          rounds. He increased his weight-class titles record to eight when, on
          November 13, 2010, he soundly defeated WBC super welterweight champion
          Antonio Margarito, who outweighed Pacquiao by 17 pounds at the time of
          the fight. Pacquiao had a 15-bout winning streak that came to an
          abrupt end in June 2012 when he lost his WBO welterweight title to
          Timothy Bradley in a controversial split decision. In December 2012 he
          lost a non-title bout to Juan Manuel Márquez—against whom Pacquiao had
          previously won two fights and drawn another—when he was knocked out in
          the sixth round. It was the first time Pacquiao had been knocked out
          since Singsurat did so in 1999. He regained the WBO welterweight belt
          in April 2014 by beating Bradley in a unanimous decision. Pacquiao’s
          next major bout was against the undefeated Floyd Mayweather in May
          2015, a much-anticipated contest that the two fighters’ camps had been
          negotiating on and off for more than six years. In that event,
          Pacquiao was unable to mount an effective offense against Mayweather,
          who was arguably the greatest defensive fighter of his generation, and
          he lost by unanimous decision. After having won a decision over
          Bradley on April 9, 2016, Pacquiao retired from boxing for four months
          before announcing another fight. On July 2, 2017, he lost a decision
          and the WBO welterweight title to Australia’s Jeff Horn. Pacquiao
          bounced back to capture the WBA welterweight title in a victory over
          Lucas Matthysse on July 15, 2018. On July 20, 2019, he won a split
          decision over the previously undefeated Keith Thurman to take the WBA
          super welterweight belt and become, at 40 years old, the oldest
          welterweight champion in boxing history. However, due to inactivity,
          in 2021 Pacquaio was stripped of the belt, which was then given to
          Yordenis Ugás of Cuba. Later that year he fought Ugás and lost by
          unanimous decision. Pacquiao subsequently announced his retirement
          from boxing with a career record of 62 wins, 8 losses, and 2 draws. In
          2003 Pacquiao was voted Person of the Year in the Philippines over
          Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, who was then two years into her term as
          president of the country. Four years later, in 2007, he unsuccessfully
          ran for a seat in the national legislature. He then returned to boxing
          full-time, but a few days after his November 2009 bout he formed a new
          “local” political party, the Peoples’ Champ Movement, back in the
          Philippines. He again declared his candidacy for a legislative seat,
          for a district in Mindanao, and, on May 10, 2010, he won by an
          overwhelming margin. He was reelected to the post in 2013. On May 9,
          2016, Pacquiao was one of 12 new senators elected to the Philippine
          Senate. In 2021 he announced his candidacy in the presidential
          election, which was held the following year. Pacquiao conceded after
          finishing a distant third behind the landslide victor, Ferdinand
          (“Bongbong”) Marcos, Jr., and second-place Leni Robredo. Also in 2022
          Pacquiao’s term in the Senate ended.

                If you have ever seen Pacquiao appear on the Jimmy Kimmel Show,
                you will know how passionate he is about music. Since 2006, he
                has been recording hit albums under Star, MCA and GMA records.
                His two studio albums are "Laban Nating Lahat Ito" and "Pac-Man

              <h3>3-Time 'Fighter of the Year' by Ring Magazine and BWAA</h3>
              <p>
                2006: Pacquiao went 3-0 against, beating Erik Morales twice and
                Oscar Larios once. He rebounded from his last defeat to Morales
                to knock him out in the rematch and the rubber match. The most
                impressive of the three was the third when Pacquiao knocked down
                "El Terrible" twice in the third round. Morales responded by
                shaking his head to his father and sat out the count. 2008:
                Pacquiao makes the move from super-featherweight to lightweight
                then to light-welterweight, challenging Juan Manuel Marquez,
                David Diaz and Oscar De La Hoya in the process. He defeated all
                three and finished Diaz and De La Hoya inside the distance.
                2009: Pacquiao made the jump once again from light-welterweight
                to welterweight. His first test was England's own Ricky Hatton.
                Pacquiao destroyed the "Hitman" in two rounds with a vicious
                left hand. He ended the year with an impressive TKO win over
                Puerto-Rican star Miguel Cotto.

              Making Time Magazine's 'Most Influential People' List in 2009
            </h3>
            <p>
              The 'Most Influential People in the World' is an annual event for
              Time magazine. Since 2004, the award-winning magazine has been
              printing top 100 lists of the "Most Influential People In the
              World." Pacquiao made the list in 2009 after his acclaim as a
              boxer and a politician made the headlines, blasting his name and
              reputation into the mainstream. His contributions to the people of
              the Philippines shines through every one of his actions, and it
              also expands to the hearts of people across the world.

            <h3>Making Oscar De La Hoya Quit</h3>
            <p>
              The biggest question going into the 2008 match with decorated
              Olympic Gold Medalist Oscar De La Hoya was could Pacquiao handle
              the bigger and stronger opponent? Pacquiao had to move from
              lightweight to welterweight to challenge the former
              pound-for-pound best boxer. "The Golden Boy" weighed in three
              pounds heavier, but Pacquiao was the one who went into the bout at
              the heavier weight. After eight rounds of one-sided action, De La
              Hoya neglected to come out for the ninth round. The speed and
              power of Pacquiao was just too much for the boxer who competed in
              six different weight divisions over his 17-year professional
              career. He retired soon after the fight.
            </p>

          <li class="achievement-item">
            <h3>Avenging His Loss and Beating Erik Morales....Twice</h3>
            <p>
              Mexican rival Erik "El Terrible" Morales is the last man to defeat
              Pacquiao. In 2005, the Mexican legend bloodied and beat up
              Pacquiao over 12 rounds to win a unanimous decision. Less than one
              year later, Pacquiao was back on the winning track, and he wanted
              revenge. He put on a show for boxing fans as he stood toe-to-toe
              with Morales for 10 rounds before getting the knockout victory. It
              was the most satisfying win of his career and proved he was
              ascending to the top of the sport. The rubber match was in
              November of 2006 and it proved to be the easiest one of the
              trilogy. Pacquiao knocked Morales down three times in three
              rounds. Morales wanted no more and waited out the count.

            <h3>Putting Ricky Hatton to Sleep in the 2nd Round</h3>
            <p>
              May 2 was the date and Ricky Hatton planned on bringing his army
              with him to challenge the Filipino superstar who was becoming one
              of the biggest and most dominant stars in sports. A HBO 24/7
              series was used to hype up the mega-fight between two action stars
              who love to stand and trade power shots. In what was supposed to
              be an all-out war, it was short and sweet for Pacquiao, who
              knocked "The Hitman" out in the second round with a devastating
              left hand. Hatton fell to the canvas with his hands over his head
              and was knocked out cold.

            <h3>Named 2000's 'Fighter of the Decade'</h3>
            <p>
              It's one thing to be named "Fighter of the Year," but to be called
              "Fighter of the Decade" is 10 times as good. The best
              pound-for-pound boxer in the world had beaten everyone in four
              different weight divisions, including Oscar De La Hoya, Ricky
              Hatton, Joshua Clottey, Miguel Cotto, Antonio Margarito, Erik
              Morales (three times), Marco Antonio Barrera (two times), Juan
              Manuel Marquez and David Diaz. Many of them were regarded as some
              of the very best boxers of their generation, and they were all
              highly-skilled challengers. No easy fights here, but Pacquiao made
              it look easy, defeating every one of them and dominating most.

              Being Elected to Public Office in the 15th Congress of the
              Philippines
            </h3>
            <p>
              In May 2010, Pacquiao was elected to the House of Representatives
              in the 15th Congress of the Philippines. It took two tries to
              become elected. He was beaten by Darlene Antonio-Custodio in his
              first attempt in 2007. Whether or not the Filipino citizens wanted
              to see him in the ring more than in the court, his recent election
              proves he can do both. He received 120,052 votes the second time
              he ran and outpointed his opponent by almost double. He has a
              tendency to outwork every opponent he faces in the ring and in the
              court, and it was no different here.

            <h3>The First Boxer to Win in Eight Weight Divisions</h3>
            <p>
              Pacquiao dominated opponents in eight different divisions. He made
              his debut at flyweight in 1995 at the age of 16. He actually
              weighed seven pounds less than the 107-pound limit, but he cheated
              to add on the extra weight. His career continued to expand as his
              body grew in size and weight. He made his way from bantamweight,
              featherweight and lightweight all the way to welterweight; a
              remarkable 40-pounds heavier than when he had made his debut. His
              opponents have weighed anywhere from 107 to 150 pounds, and he has
              beaten them to claim a record of 52-3-2 with 38 KOs. There have
              been rumors that he may still move up to light middleweight, which
              would be an amazing feat and an amazing achievement in the long
              list of achievements he already has.

            <h3>Winning Four Lineal Championships</h3>
            <p>
              Many boxing fans consider the lineal champion to be the people's
              champion. With multiple champions and belts in each division, it's
              hard to figure out who the real champion is. Look no further than
              Pacquiao. He managed to not only become the real lightweight
              champion, but also the featherweight, bantamweight and flyweight
              champions during his extensive reign. All-time great Henry
              Armstrong was a lineal champion in three different weight
              divisions, but Pacquiao was the first to win four. The comparison
              is often made between the two influential stars of their eras.
              These are the types of things that make a boxer stand above all
              the rest, and he's not even done yet.
